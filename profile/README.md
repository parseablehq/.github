Parseable is an open source, Kubernetes native, log storage and observability platform. 

Written in Rust, Parseable has a low CPU, memory footprint and offers low latency, high throughput, out of the box. 

Parseable is designed keeping modern cloud native infrastructure at its heart. This means Parseable can be deployed in cloud and container based environments in minutes and can scale as the requirements grow.
